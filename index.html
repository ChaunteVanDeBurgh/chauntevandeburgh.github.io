	<h2>Music</h2>
	<p>Chaunte’s primary instrument is guitar. He plays lead guitar in the psychedelic folk rock group, Aaron Hale and the Human Beings. He also plays and sings acoustic style music in bars all over Oklahoma. Chaunte plays piano, drums, and guitar almost every day--focussing on composition. Chaunte can--and does--read music, but focuses on improvising and collaborating. Over the years he’s played many instruments. At the age of four years old, Chaunte’s mother taught him how to play the C-major scale on a recorder. She then showed him that with those notes, one could make beautiful melodies. In grade school he played trumpet and sang in the choir. In high-school he switched to percussion, and sang as a first tenor in the honor choir. Now, Chaunte tours with Aaron Hale and the Human Beings, every summer.</p>

	<h2>Code</h2>
	<p>Chaunte VandeBurgh wrote his first line of code when he was only ten years old. It was in <em>python</em>:</p>
	<p id="codeblock"> print(“Hello, world!”)</p><p>After briefly wrestling with tKinter, a third party GUI library for python, he moved on to learning HTML, Javascript, and CSS. He toiled with the web languages through the rest of grade school. In his early adult life, Chaunte became well versed in <em>C, C++, Assembler, Java, Python,</em> many web tools and web languages, as well as google web services. Currently, he focuses on bioinformatics--using machine learning algorithms with biological data sets.</p>
